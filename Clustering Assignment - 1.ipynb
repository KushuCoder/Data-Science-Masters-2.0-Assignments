    "Clustering algorithms can be categorized into the following types:\n",

    "Centroid-based clustering (e.g., K-means)\n",
    "   Approach: Partitions the data into clusters based on centroids. The algorithm tries to minimize the sum of squared distances from data points to the cluster centroids.\n",
    "   Assumptions: Assumes clusters are spherical and roughly of similar size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN, OPTICS)\n",
    "   Approach: Defines clusters as regions of high density, separated by low-density regions.\n",
    "   Assumptions: Assumes clusters are dense regions of data points and doesn't require the number of clusters to be predefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution-based clustering (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models)\n",
    "   Approach: Models each cluster as a probability distribution, typically Gaussian. Assigns data points to clusters based on the likelihood of their belonging to each distribution.\n",
    "   Assumptions: Assumes data is generated from a mixture of probability distributions.\n",

    "Hierarchical clustering (e.g., Agglomerative, Divisive)\n",
    "   Approach: Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent nested clusters. Can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\n",
    "   Assumptions: Assumes that data can be grouped hierarchically and does not require a predefined number of clusters.\n",
